## Installation
```sh
pip install more-itertools
```
(or)
```sh
pip3 install more-itertools
```

## Disclaimer
There may be instances where the program may not work correctly. To avoid this, you may create a local virtual environment and pip install within the env. Activate the env when running the program.

```sh
python3 -m venv envStockMaximization
```

## Usage Example
Run main.py on the terminal or through an IDE after installing the necessary module(s).

Additionally, a built-in debugging assistance tool may be run. In the debugger tool file, toggle-able booleans may be used to define scope. To adjust input and output file names, refer to the settings file.

User may generate a new input file, overwrite any existing input file, quantity of test cases, and the min-max values per each parameter. Specifications for each parameter are listed within the debugger tool file. These may assist in creating test cases.
```sh
python3 SPMP_debug.py
```

### Sample Input
